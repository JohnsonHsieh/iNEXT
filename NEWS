# iNEXT 2.0.12
- Fixes vignettes error for `ggplot2` update.
- Adds argument `conf` for `estimateD` function.
- Fixes issue #12, 13

# iNEXT 2.0.13
- Fixes the plot display `NA` in the legend (After `ggplot2` was updated to version 2.2.0)

# iNEXT 2.0.14
- Fixes the warning message for `EstiBootComm.Ind` and `EstiBootComm.Sam`.

# iNEXT 2.0.15
- Modify the incidence case to make  it consistent with abundance case.

# iNEXT 2.0.16
- Modify the BootstrapFun for oddly warning message (issue #31).

# iNEXT 2.0.17
- Modify Error in duplicated levels/labels (issue #25).

# iNEXT 2.0.18
- Update ggiNEXT.R (Fix legend problem of ggiNEXT).

# iNEXT 2.0.19
- Modified `Dqhat.Ind` and `Dqhat.Sam` to make them more efficient.

# iNEXT 2.0.20
- Modify Error in R 4.0.0 (issue #46).

# iNEXT 2.1.0
- Add the parameter q to estimateD function. And its output form is correspondingly slightly changed.
- Change the facet label of diversity order in ggiNEXT from `0`, `1`, `2` to `q = 0`,`q = 1`, `q = 2`, respectively.
- Change the default colors of ggiNEXT to make them color-blind friendly.
- Improve the efficiency of `Dqhat.Ind` and rename it as `TD.m.est`. (Similarly, `Dqhat.Sam` is renamed as `TD.m.est_inc`)

# iNEXT 2.1.1
- Change default value of `level` of `estimateD` if it is not specified by users.
- Correct version number in description file.

# iNEXT 2.1.2
- Correct the facet label when `type = 2` in `ggiNEXT`, which is supposed not to appear.
- Slighty modification on the confidence interval method for asymptotic estimates.
- Fix a bug in the incidence extrapolation.
- Fix a bug in the asymptotic profile.

# iNEXT 2.1.3
- Fix a bug in estimateD when the necessary size for a small coverage is 1.

# iNEXT 2.1.4
- Now the parameter "level" in estimateD can be a vector.
- Slightly modify the bootstrap method in estimateD when base="coverage".

# iNEXT 2.1.5
- Fix a bug about the C.I of estimateD when the length of desired 'level' > 1.

# iNEXT 2.1.6
- Modify the C.I of asymptotic diversity of q = 1 and 2: cancel the trucation.

# iNEXT 2.1.7
- Slightly modify the example of estimateD.

# iNEXT 2.2.0
- Add the coverage-based bootstrap method into function 'iNEXT()'.
- Notation changes in column names: 'site'/'Site' -> 'Assemblage', 'order' -> 'Order.q', 'method' -> 'Method'.
- Notation changes in arguments 'facet.var' and 'color.var' of function 'ggiNEXT()': 
'none' -> 'None', 'order' -> 'Order.q', 'site' -> 'Assemblage', 'both' -> 'Both'. 
- Now there two elements(data.frames) in $iNextEst, the first is $size_based and the second
is $coverage_based, instead of N elements(data.frames), where N is the # of assemblages.
- An additional character column 'Assemblage' is added into each element(data.frame) of $iNextEst to
identify different assemblages.

# iNEXT 2.2.1
- Fix the notations in function 'EstimateD()': 'site'/'Site' -> 'Assemblage'

# iNEXT 2.2.2
- Update README.md and README.Rmd at github according to the changes in iNEXT 2.2.0 and iNEXT 2.2.1.
- Add an additional choice of argument 'type' in ggiNEXT. Now type = 4 will perform the same plotting function as type = 3 from the previous version (before 2.2.0).

# iNEXT 2.2.3
- Remove the second change in iNEXT 2.2.2. 

# iNEXT 2.2.5
- Fix a minor potential bug invChat.Ind and invChat.Sam that may occur when f1 = 0, f2 > 0. 

# iNEXT 3.0.0
- Update vignette, package manual, and remove functions 'ChaoSpecies' and 'ChaoEntropy'.
